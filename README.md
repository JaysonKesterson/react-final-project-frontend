Project Title

Bargain Hunter is a buying/selling application designed for user's to buy and sell items in stores! User's can add funds to their balance, sell items to gain more balance and purchase items for their balance to diminish.

Getting Started

From the front end you will need to launch npm start and make an account to create a store and add items to it!
